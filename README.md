# Overview:

This analysis delves into the social media usage patterns of 21 students within a classroom setting. The dataset encompasses various platforms including Instagram, LinkedIn, Snapchat, Twitter, WhatsApp, YouTube, Over-the-top (OTT) services, Reddit, and factors related to sleep habits. The analysis progresses through correlation analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), cluster analysis, and factor analysis to extract meaningful insights into students' social media habits and their potential impact on sleep.

# Data Dictionary:

ID: Unique identifier for each student.

Instagram Usage: Average daily time spent on Instagram (in hours).

LinkedIn Usage: Average daily time spent on LinkedIn (in hours).

Snapchat Usage: Average daily time spent on Snapchat (in hours).

Twitter Usage: Average daily time spent on Twitter (in hours).

Whatsapp Usage: Average daily time spent on WhatsApp (in hours).

Youtube Usage: Average daily time spent on YouTube (in hours).

OTT (Over-the-top) Usage: Average daily time spent on Over-the-top services (in hours).

Reddit Usage: Average daily time spent on Reddit (in hours).

Trouble_falling_asleep: Indicates whether the student experiences trouble falling asleep (Yes/No).


Note:

The time spent on each social media platform is self-reported by the students.
Trouble_falling_asleep is a binary variable indicating whether the student faces difficulty falling asleep, based on self-assessment.


# Correlation Analysis:
The initial step involved examining the correlation between different social media platforms and sleep-related factors. Correlation coefficients were calculated to determine the strength and direction of relationships between variables. This provided a foundational understanding of how different platforms relate to each other and their potential effects on sleep quality.

# Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
PCA was employed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining as much variance as possible. By transforming the original variables into a smaller set of principal components, PCA facilitated the identification of underlying patterns in social media usage among the students. This allowed for a more concise representation of the data and simplified subsequent analyses.

# Cluster Analysis:
Cluster analysis was conducted to group students based on their social media usage patterns. By identifying clusters of students with similar usage behaviors across multiple platforms, this analysis elucidated distinct subgroups within the class. Understanding these clusters can provide valuable insights into how students engage with social media and how usage patterns may vary across different segments of the population.

# Factor Analysis:
Finally, factor analysis was employed to explore underlying constructs or latent variables within the dataset. This technique helped uncover common patterns or themes among the various social media platforms and sleep-related factors. By identifying these underlying factors, the analysis aimed to provide a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between social media usage and sleep habits among students.

# Conclusion:
Through a multi-faceted analysis incorporating correlation, PCA, cluster analysis, and factor analysis, this study offers valuable insights into the social media usage patterns of students within a classroom setting. By understanding the relationships between different platforms and their potential impact on sleep, educators and policymakers can develop strategies to promote healthier digital habits among students. This analysis serves as a foundational step towards fostering greater awareness and informed decision-making regarding social media usage in educational environments.
